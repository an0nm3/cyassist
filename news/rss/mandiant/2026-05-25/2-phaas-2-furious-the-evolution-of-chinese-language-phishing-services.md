While Russian-speaking threat actors have historically dominated the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) landscape, a rival ecosystem is rapidly growing within the Chinese-language underground. Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) analyzed a dozen current PhaaS offerings in the Chinese underground, all of them mature services and many likely tied intricately to the broader criminal ecosystem in that region. These services not only lower the barrier to entry for Chinese cyber criminals, but reveal broader patterns on the evolution of social engineering and credential theft.    Late last year   , Google took legal action against one PhaaS provider and has worked since then to endorse legislation and enact technical safeguards against these types of scams.  
  Within this ecosystem, GTIG has observed a fundamental move away from static password harvesting towards real-time interception and tokenization. By utilizing live administration panels, attackers can interact with victims in real-time to capture one-time passcodes (OTPs), allowing them to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) instantly.  
  Instead of simply gaining account access, these operations focus on exploiting digital wallet provisioning to transform stolen payment data into tokenized assets within ecosystems. This shift—combined with the use of encrypted delivery channels like RCS and iMessage to bypass traditional carrier security filters on SMS messages—represents an emerging development where the goal is no longer just a login, but securing direct, unauthorized control over a victim's financial accounts.

   The Chinese-Language PhaaS Ecosystem   
  The Chinese-language PhaaS ecosystem is not merely a regional mirror of Russian operations – it is a distinct market shaped by a unique professional culture. Nearly all the legitimate organizations mimicked by these phishing services are non-Chinese entities, suggesting they rarely target China.  
 
 
  Public impact:   Unlike the major Russia-based PhaaS offerings that are typically used to target customers of large organizations, phishing services advertised in Chinese-language communities are often designed to target the general public more opportunistically.  
 
 
  Open Operations:   In contrast to their Russian-speaking counterparts, providers of Chinese-language phishing services often operate openly with less regard for operational security. For instance, the threat actors running these services regularly post photos of their luxury lifestyles on Telegram.  
 
 
  Focus on Telegram:   Advertisements for the phishing services are regularly posted to Telegram rather than channels such as WeChat (Weixin) or Tencent QQ, which are regionally more popular. This approach is consistent with the broader Chinese-language cyber crime ecosystem.  
 
 
  Extensive offering:   While PhaaS is at the core of these operations, these developers also typically offer numerous ancillary services, forming a complete, mature, and extensive offering. These include the sale of personally identifiable information (PII), domain name registration and virtual private server (VPS) hosting services, server rentals, money laundering services, eavesdropping devices (International Mobile Subscriber Identity [IMSI] catchers), and message sending services (spamming assistance). Some platform vendors are also involved in trading stolen payment card information.   
 
 
  Notable Chinese-Language PhaaS TTPs  
 
  Delivery via RCS and iMessage:   These attacks begin by exploiting trust in modern communication. Rather than traditional SMS, these Chinese-language PhaaS operators heavily leverage Rich Communication Services (RCS) and Apple’s iMessage. Protocols that use end-to-end encryption make it difficult for server-side delivery infrastructure to inspect or filter malicious links, which makes on-device protections critical. Messages also contain more extensive engagement features (including read receipts, typing indicators, group chat functionalities, as well as the ability to send high-resolution images, videos, and larger files). This makes them ideal for social engineering operations, as lures appear remarkably legitimate to the average user.   
  Real-time Interception:   When a victim clicks a malicious link and enters their credentials, the data is displayed instantly on an administrative panel. This allows an adversary to interact with the victim in real-time. As the victim is prompted for an OTP, an attacker simultaneously triggers that same OTP request on their own device. The victim enters the code into the phishing page, and the attacker captures it seconds before it expires.  
  Leveraging Digital Wallets for Monetization:   A defining characteristic of these operations is their exploitation of digital wallet provisioning to monetize stolen payment details. Attackers use captured credentials and OTPs to provision the victim’s card into a digital wallet on an attacker-controlled device. Once tokenized, the card can be used for high-value transactions, contactless payments, and ATM withdrawals. While payment card data theft is the focus, this ecosystem also develops brokerage-focused templates, which can be used to facilitate traditional account takeovers (ATO) for wire fraud and stock manipulation.  
  AI-Based Automation:   Multiple Chinese-language PhaaS operators have adopted AI for their operations to enable scale and stealth. As one example, the Darcula PhaaS platform, which we link to UNC5814, has moved away from static templates, instead utilizing AI-powered page generators and browser automation tools like Puppeteer. This enables users to clone legitimate websites by replicating their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and visual elements through providing the target website's URL. As each phishing page is unique as opposed to relying on static templates, signature-based detection methods are rendered increasingly ineffective.   
 
  Localization-as-a-Service  
  The Chinese-speaking PhaaS ecosystem has shifted towards a highly automated model capable of generating localized content for diverse international markets. Unlike traditional phishing kits that have historically relied on static and poorly translated templates, these operators provide the infrastructure for cultural fluency at scale. By offering everything from AI-powered page generators to region-specific delivery assistance, they enable low-skilled affiliates to launch high-fidelity campaigns.   
  YY Lai Yu (YY来鱼): A Case Study in Localization  
  YY Lai Yu (YY来鱼), first advertised in August 2024, is one example of a PhaaS offering that provides a local digital ecosystem. While the platform supports phishing across 119 countries, its largest focus has been on Japan. Managed by a core team including "YY Lai Yu," "Jeffrey Carrie," and "Very casual," the service provides Chinese-speaking threat actors with the localized infrastructure necessary to effectively target the Japanese consumer ecosystem.

   Since November 2025, YY Lai Yu has offered more than 400 phishing templates to its customers, moving beyond generic banking lures to also target the digital lifestyle of Japanese residents. These templates included various Japanese language and Japanese brands, including for Amazon, Apple, DMM, Epos Card, JA Bank, JCB Card, JR (Rail), Matsui Securities, Mercari, Monex, Nintendo, Nomura Securities, Orico Card, PayPay, Rakuten Securities, and Sagawa Express. However, instead of merely providing fake account pages, the threat actors tapped heavily into local consumer habits by developing "points" (积分) and rewards redemption lures, pressuring victims to redeem supposedly expiring loyalty points for cash or goods. Demonstrating a deep awareness of the local economic climate, the operators also exploited cost-of-living concerns by crafting lures around the Japan Winter Electricity Subsidy.   
  By deploying distinct domains that impersonate everything from local transit and payment apps to major e-commerce and gaming platforms, YY Lai Yu provides an example of how comprehensive these PhaaS offerings have become. To protect this highly localized infrastructure, the phishing sites featured a unique human verification anti-bot screen that appeared prior to the actual phishing page. By requiring a manual click to proceed, this mechanism successfully hindered automated analysis by security vendors, adding a layer of stealth to the localized campaign.  
  Like most other services, YY Lai Yu leverages RCS and iMessage to send encrypted messages in bulk and supports synchronized interactions with victims to harvest payment card and OTP data. The administration panel allows users to query their phished data and blocklist or highlight certain types of cards according to their BIN number, blocklist individual countries or territories, and register and manage new domains for their phishing pages using Alibaba's domain registration service. Additionally, panel administrators can create new operator users and assign them permissions. The service also offers domains that can be purchased within the administration panel.   
  While YY Lai Yu showcases a focus on countries like Japan, the broader Chinese PhaaS ecosystem casts a wide global net. GTIG has observed other prominent services routinely deploying automated infrastructure to compromise users across the Americas, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East.   
  Outlook   
  The continued popularity of these services demonstrates a sustained interest in payment card fraud from China-based threat actors. The multitude of sophisticated PhaaS platforms available for purchase and the threat actors' focus on the exploitation of digital wallet tokenization and MFA bypass demonstrates that the China-based criminal ecosystem continues to evolve, enabling threat actors with limited technical skills to conduct phishing operations.   
  Standard phishing security measures (such as user awareness training) remain an important first line of defense. However, the proliferation of the Chinese-language PhaaS ecosystem underscores a need for technical security controls that go beyond user education. For example, transitioning to FIDO2/WebAuthn infrastructure represents an effective countermeasure against the real-time interception of account authentication OTPs. While security keys cannot prevent a user from entering payment details into a novel phishing site directly, increasing the difficulty of leveraging stolen credentials still radically shrinks an adversary's opportunities. These enterprise authentication upgrades should be paired with risk-based verification and device fingerprinting by issuing banks during the digital wallet provisioning process.  
  As these operators continue to refine their tooling, the goal for defenders must shift from simply "detecting" a phish to making the victim's credentials technically impossible to weaponize. Ongoing and frequent updates to these platforms indicate that Chinese-speaking PhaaS operators are continuing to refine their tooling to maximize global impact.
