 Google is continuously advancing the security of Pixel devices. We have been focusing on hardening the cellular baseband modem against exploitation.  Recognizing the risks  associated within the complex modem firmware, Pixel 9 shipped with  mitigations  against a range of memory-safety vulnerabilities. For Pixel 10, Google is advancing its proactive security measures further. Following our previous discussion on  "Deploying Rust in Existing Firmware Codebases" , this post shares a concrete application: integrating a memory-safe Rust DNS(Domain Name System) parser into the modem firmware. The new Rust-based DNS parser significantly reduces our security risk by mitigating an entire class of vulnerabilities in a risky area, while also laying the foundation for broader adoption of memory-safe code in other areas. 

 Here we share our experience of working on it, and hope it can inspire the use of more memory safe languages in low-level environments. 

 Why Modem Memory Safety Can’t Wait 
 In recent years, we have seen increasing interest in the cellular modem from attackers and security researchers. For example, Google's Project Zero  gained remote code execution  on Pixel modems over the Internet. Pixel modem has tens of Megabytes of executable code. Given the complexity and remote attack surface of the modem, other critical memory safety vulnerabilities may remain in the predominantly memory-unsafe firmware code. 

 Why DNS? 
 The DNS protocol is most commonly known in the context of browsers finding websites. With the evolution of cellular technology, modern cellular communications have migrated to digital data networks; consequently, even basic operations such as call forwarding rely on DNS services. 

 DNS is a complex protocol and requires parsing of untrusted data, which can lead to vulnerabilities, particularly when implemented in a memory-unsafe language (example:  CVE-2024-27227 ). Implementing the DNS parser in Rust offers value by decreasing the attack surfaces associated with memory unsafety. 

 Picking a DNS library 
 DNS already has a level of support in the open-source Rust community. We evaluated multiple open source crates that implement DNS. Based on  criteria shared in earlier posts , we identified  hickory-proto  as the best candidate. It has excellent maintenance, over 75% test coverage, and widespread adoption in the Rust community. Its pervasiveness shows its potential as the de-facto DNS choice and long term support. Although hickory-proto initially lacked  no_std  support, which is needed for Bare-metal environments (see our  previous post  on this topic), we were able to add support to it and its dependencies. 

 Adding  no_std  support 
 The work to enable  no_std  for hickory-proto is mostly mechanical. We shared the process  in a previous post . We undertook modifications to hickory_proto and its dependencies to enable  no_std  support. The upstream  no_std  work also results in a  no_std  URL parser, beneficial to other projects. 

 
    https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2104  
    https://github.com/servo/rust-url/pull/831  
    https://github.com/krisprice/ipnet/pull/58  
 

 The above PRs are great examples of how to extend  no_std  support to existing std-only crates. 

 Code size study 
 Code size is the one of the factors that we evaluated when picking the DNS library to use. 

 
   
     
       Code size by category 
       Rust implemented Shim that calls Hickory-proto on receiving a DNS response 
       4KB 
     
     
       core, alloc, compiler_builtins (reusable, one-time cost) 
       17KB 
     
     
       Hickory-proto library and dependencies 
       350KB 
     
   
 

 
 
 

 
   
     
       Sum 
        
       371KB 
     
   
 


 We built prototypes and measured size with  size-optimized settings . Expectedly,  hickory_proto  is not designed with embedded use in mind, and is not optimized for size. As the Pixel modem is not tightly memory constrained, we prioritized community support and code quality, leaving code size optimizations as future work. 

 However, the additional code size may be a blocker for other embedded systems. This could be addressed in the future by adding additional feature flags to conditionally compile only required functionality. Implementing this modularity would be a valuable future work. 

 Hook-up Rust to modem firmware 
 Before building the Rust DNS library, we defined several Rust unit tests to cover basic arithmetic, dynamic allocations, and   FFI   to verify the integration of Rust with the existing modem firmware code base. 

 Compile Rust code to staticlib 
 While using  cargo  is the default choice for compilation in the Rust ecosystem, it  presents challenges  when integrating it into existing build systems. We evaluated two options: 

 
   Using  cargo  to build a   staticlib   before the modem builds. Then add the produced staticlib into the linking step. 
   Directly work with  rustc  and integrate the Rust compilation steps into the existing modem build system. 
 

 Option #1 does not scale if we are going to add more Rust components in the future, as linking multiple staticlibs may cause  duplicated symbol errors . We chose option #2 as it scales more easily and allows tighter integration into our existing build system. Our existing C/C++ codebase uses  Pigweed  to drive the primary build system. Pigweed supports Rust targets ( example ) with direct calls to   rustc   through   rust tools  defined in  GN  . 

 We compiled all the Rust crates, including hickory-proto, its dependencies, and core, compiler_builtin, alloc, to   rlib  . Then, we created a  staticlib  target with a single lib.rs file which references all the   rlib   crates using   extern crate   keywords. 

 Build core, alloc, and compiler_builtins 
  Android’s Rust Toolchain  distributes source code of  core ,  alloc , and  compiler_builtins , and we leveraged this for the modem. They can be included to the build graph by adding a  GN  target with   crate_root   pointing to the root  lib.rs  of each crate. 

 Pixel modem firmware already has a well-tested and specialized global memory allocation system to support some dynamic memory allocations.  alloc  support was added by implementing the  GlobalAlloc  with  FFI  calls to the allocators C APIs: 

  use core::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout};

extern "C" {
    fn mem_malloc(size: usize, alignment: usize) -&gt; *mut u8;
    fn mem_free(ptr: *mut u8, alignment: usize);
}

struct MemAllocator;

unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for MemAllocator {
    unsafe fn alloc(&amp;self, layout: Layout) -&gt; *mut u8 {
        mem_malloc(layout.size(), layout.align())
    }

    unsafe fn dealloc(&amp;self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {
        mem_free(ptr, layout.align());
    }
}

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOCATOR: MemAllocator = MemAllocator;
  

 Pixel modem firmware already implements a backend for the Pigweed  crash facade  as the global crash handler. Exposing it into Rust  panic_handler  through FFI unifies the crash handling for both Rust and C/C++ code. 

  #![no_std]
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

extern "C" {
    pub fn PwCrashBackend(sigature: *const i8, file_name: *const i8, line: u32);
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(panic_info: &amp;PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {
    let mut filename = "";
    let mut line_number: u32 = 0;

    if let Some(location) = panic_info.location() {
        filename = location.file();
        line_number = location.line();
    }

    let mut cstr_buffer = [0u8; 128];
    // Never writes to the last byte to make sure `cstr_buffer` is always zero
    // terminated.
    let (_, writer) = cstr_buffer.split_last_mut().unwrap();
    for (place, ch) in writer.iter_mut().zip(filename.bytes()) {
        *place = ch;
    }

    unsafe {
        PwCrashBackend(
            "Rust panic\0".as_ptr() as *const i8,
            cstr_buffer.as_ptr() as *const i8,
            line_number,
        );
    }

    loop {}
}
  

 Link Rust staticlib 
 The Pixel modem firmware linking has a step that calls the linker to link all the objects generated from C/C++ code. By using  llvm-ar -x  to extract object files from the Rust combined staticlib and supplying them to the linker, the Rust code appears in the final modem image. 

 There was a performance issue we experienced due to weak symbols during linking. The inclusion of Rust  core  and  compiler-builtin  caused unexpected power and performance regressions on various tests. Upon analysis, we realized that modem optimized implementations of  memset  and  memcpy  provided by the modem firmware are accidentally replaced by those defined in  compiler_builtin . It seems to happen because both  compiler_builtin  crate and the existing codebase defines symbols as weak, linker has no way to figure out which one is weaker. We fixed the regression by stripping the  compiler_builtin  crate before linking using a one line shell script. 

  llvm-ar -t &lt;rust staticlib&gt; | grep compiler_builtins | xargs llvm-ar -d &lt;rust staticlib&gt;
  

 Integrating hickory-proto 

 Expose Rust API and calling back to C++ 
 For the DNS parser, we declared the DNS response parsing API in C and then implemented  the same API  in Rust. 

  int32_t process_dns_response(uint8_t*, int32_t);
  

 The Rust function returns an integer standing for the error code. The received DNS answers in the DNS response are required to be updated to in-memory data structures that are coupled with the original C implementation, therefore, we use existing C functions to do it. The existing C functions are dispatched from the Rust implementation. 

  pub unsafe extern "C" fn process_dns_response(
    dns_response: *const u8,
    response_len: i32,
) -&gt; i32 {
    //... validate inputs `dns_response` and `response_len`.


    // SAFETY:
    // It is safe because `dns_response` is null checked above. `response_len`
    // is passed in, safe as long as it is set correctly by vendor code.
    match process_response(unsafe {
        slice::from_raw_parts(dns_response, response_len)
    }) {
         Ok(()) =&gt; 0,
         Err(err) =&gt; err.into(),
    }
}

fn process_response(response: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let response = hickory_proto::op::Message::from_bytes(response)?;
    let response = hickory_proto::xfer::DnsResponse::from_message(response)?;

   
    for answer in response.answers() {  
        match answer.record_type() {
            hickory_proto::RecordType:... =&gt; {
                // SAFETY:
                // It is safe because the callback function does not store
                // reference of the inputs or their members.
                unsafe {
                    callback_to_c_function(...)?;
                }
            }
            
            // ... more match arms omitted.
        }    
    }

    Ok(())
}
  

 In our case, the DNS responding parsing function API is simple enough for us to hand write, while the callbacks back to C functions for handling the response have complex data type conversions. Therefore, we leveraged bindgen to generate FFI code for the callbacks. 

 Build third-party crates 
 Even with all features disabled, hickory-proto introduces more than 30 dependent crates. Manually written build rules are difficult to ensure correctness and scale poorly when upgrading dependencies into new versions. 

 Fuchsia has developed   cargo-gnaw   to support building their third party Rust crates.  Cargo-gnaw  works by invoking  cargo metadata  to resolve dependencies, then parse and generate GN build rules. This ensures correctness and ease of maintenance. 

 Conclusion 
 The Pixel 10 series of phones marks a pivotal moment, being the first Pixel device to integrate a memory-safe language into its modem. 

 While replacing one piece of risky attack surface is itself valuable, this project lays the foundation for future integration of memory-safe parsers and code into the cellular baseband, ensuring the baseband’s security posture will  continue to improve  as development continues.
